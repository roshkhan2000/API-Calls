# API-Calls

This repository contains practical examples and guides for calling different APIs using tools like Alteryx and Python.

It’s aimed at data and analytics folks who want to understand how APIs work in the real world — from authentication and headers to payloads and responses — without getting buried in unnecessary theory.

Simple scripts, clear explanations, and reusable code you can adapt for your own projects.
